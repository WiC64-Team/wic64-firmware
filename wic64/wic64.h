    /* Global transfer buffer of 65536+1 bytes. This
     * is the maximum transfer length defined by the
     * protocol, plus another byte reserved in order
     * to interpret the data as a null-terminated
     * c-string. (see Data::c_str()).
     *
     * This buffer is used for incoming requests
     * as well as outgoing responses, unless the
     * response is queued. In the latter case the
     * data is transferred via an RTOS queue of
     * 16kb.
     *
     * The reason this buffer is not statically
     * allocated is that on the esp32, the amount
     * of statically allocatable memory is limited
     * due to hard coded memory locations in the
     * esps roms, so the general advice is to
     * dynamically allocate large buffers even
     * though a static allocation would seem the more
     * appropriate thing to do.
     *
     * Since this buffer is allocated early in the
     * WiC64 constructor and never freed, this will
     * not contribute to any heap fragmentation.
